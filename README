# Overview
This play uses the subscription module to register your system to Red Hat, then enables the needed repositories.

Next it downloads a list of rpms that need to be in a custom repo.  It then copies the downloaded rpms to a specified location to be shared out via http as a repo.  Finally it makes a .repo file that will point back to the custom repo.
